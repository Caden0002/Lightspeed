# Lightspeed
After spending a year in the crypto industry, I was inspired to embark on my journey as a frontend developer. One of my initial ideas was to build a website that displays real-life crypto data. Lightspeed is a crypto platform that empowers users to access real-time information on all cryptocurrencies.

## Tech Stack ##
React<br />
Tailwind<br />
Axios API<br />

## Tech Debt ##
Current search bar does not search the whole cryptocurrency table but instead just the current page of the table.
